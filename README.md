# PHP User Manager
This is an extension of my tutorial, [Master Pages in PHP](https://github.com/garciart/Master-Pages-In-PHP "Master Pages in PHP", incorporating a user administration system (using SQLite) and Bootstrap styling. Simply clone, rename the project, and add your own pages!

While my first programs were written in Basic and Assembly Language, the language I've used the most is C. To this day, if I have to write a quick utility program, I'll knock it out in C. So, it's not surprising that when I began to develop applications for the web, I started with C# and ASP.NET. All in all, I have written quite a few web sites using the lessons I learned from [Cristian Darieâ€™s excellent book, Beginning ASP.NET 2.0 E-Commerce in C# 2005: From Novice to Professional](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781590594681 "Beginning ASP.NET 2.0 E-Commerce in C# 2005").

However, while I love .NET, it has its limitations. For example, once you reach a certain point, .NET is not free, and neither are Microsoft's development or production tools (e.g., Visual Studio, SQL Server, etc.). Another issue is that many companies do not provide .NET hosting services. Hopefully, .NET Core, the cross-platform successor to .NET, will take off. In the meantime, to better serve my clients, I began to create alternative versions of my boilerplates in other languages, such as PHP and JavaScript. 

One of my boilerplates was a version of that beloved tool that many of us miss: The Web Site Administration Tool. Here it is for PHP, extending one of my previous tutorials, Master Pages in PHP. Feel free to copy it and use it if you need an authentication and user administration system. Have fun and good luck!
